<p>No matter what the age or body type, if there’s one thing almost any woman can agree on when it comes to our bodies around this time of the year, it’s that we want to get them summer ready. For many, this includes getting their abs (and butt) as toned as possible. Because of this very fact, we are going to provide you with some cool tips on how to do that in just a sec. But first, let’s get a little into what causes belly fat in the first place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While many individuals are concerned with belly fat strictly due to cosmetic reasons, it should go on record that too much of it can also cause health issues down the road. That’s because that kind of fat oftentimes contains what’s known as visceral fat, a type of fat that surrounds internal organs and can lead to type 2 diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, what are some of the top causes of belly fat? Age. Sugary foods and drinks. Alcohol. A lack of exercise. Not getting enough protein. Stress. Even a lack of sleep.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The good news is knowing this can help you to develop a daily regimen that can shed some pounds. If you’d like a few tips on how to do that, here are some of our favorite ones.</p>

<h2><strong>Foods That’ll Tone Your Body</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Remember how we said that two things that cause belly fat are too much sugar and not enough protein? Something else that’s a culprit is not getting enough fiber (fiber is what helps to remove waste, right?). So, it would make perfect sense, that one way to get the fat off so that your abs can show through is to reduce the amount of junk food—i.e., &nbsp;sugary stuff—that you eat (and fruit juice that you drink; fruit juice has loads of sugar in it!).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As far as upping your protein goes—eggs, peas, quinoa, Greek yogurt, tuna,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.trendymami.com/2018/08/16/benefits-of-avocados/" target="_blank">avocado</a>&nbsp;and turkey have lots of protein in them. Foods that are high in fiber include green veggies, blackberries, popcorn, beans, oranges, apples and almonds. Eat these and watch how the belly fat melts away!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oh—and if you’re wondering how to build muscle in the abs and/or butt department, there are certain other kinds of foods that you should consume. Some that immediately come to mind are chicken breast, lean beef, chickpeas, peanuts, brown rice, salmon and cottage cheese.</p>

<h2><strong>Exercises That’ll Get Your Abs and Butt in Shape</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, getting your midsection where you want to be requires doing more than just eating right. It’s also important to burn a few calories by implementing a few exercises no less than 3-4 times a week too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In our video, here are some of the exercises for your abs and your butt that we feature:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"><img src="https://trendymami.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Toning-Muscles-with-abs-and-butt-workout-2-300x169.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5752"/></figure>

<h2><strong>Band walks (2 x 20 reps)</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These are super easy. All you need to do is put the bands on your feet and step first to the left a couple of times and then to the right, all the while allowing the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.winktwk.com/4XKLCJ/8D2R9MS/?uid=157177&amp;sub1=10MinuteatHomeAbsandButtWorkoutforToningMuscles&amp;sub2=bands&amp;sub4=good%20ab%20workouts%20at%20home&amp;sub5=false">bands</a>&nbsp;to push back and build up some resistance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Butterflies band above then knees squat position (2×20 reps)</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To pull this particular exercise off, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.winktwk.com/4XKLCJ/8D2R9MS/?uid=157177&amp;sub1=10MinuteatHomeAbsandButtWorkoutforToningMuscles&amp;sub2=bands&amp;sub4=good%20ab%20workouts%20at%20home&amp;sub5=false">band</a>&nbsp;now needs to move up towards your knees. Then you slightly squat and move your knees in and out in a butterfly-like position (it’s kind of like doing the funky chicken dance!).</p>

<h2><strong>Pigeon slides 3 x 10 each leg</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In order to do the pigeon slide, you’ll need a throw pillow to anchor one leg and a cloth to keep your other foot from sliding around (if you have hardwood floors, that is). Start with the left leg. Put it into the position that you would if you were sitting in the Lotus meditative position. Then extend the right leg behind you and use that leg to move your body to a full upright to a slanted position.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Plank slides 2 x 20 reps</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once again, with the assistance of your throw pillow and your cloth, use the cloth to keep both of your feet from sliding around and your pillow to anchor your elbows. Extend your body as far as you comfortably can and then use your knees to push your lower body towards your upper body.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After you’ve tried these for a few days, you might want to bring a little more variety into the mix for your abs and butt workout.&nbsp;Other exercises that can develop your abs include push-ups, crunches, sit-ups, leg raises and Russian twists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, if you want to put more focus on your butt, lunges are awesome! So are barbell squats, deadlifts, squat jumps, running up and down stairs and doing Bulgarian Split Squat.</p>

<p>Just one more thing. It’s important to mention that smoothies can pack on pounds too if you have them every day or (worse) with a meal or several times a day. So, just so your smoothie consumption works with you and not against you, try and have these no more than a couple of times a week.</p>

<p>If you do that (along with everything else that we shared), you’ll be abs and butt ready in no time!</p>
