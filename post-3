<p>Over the last years, I noticed something exciting, just by paying attention to what other guys were wearing. Most men can go up by two points, only by adjusting a few things when it comes to style—that means going from a 6 to an 8, or an 8 to a 10.</p>

<p>Yes, “looks, aren’t everything!” And yes, I agree 100 per cent with you, but <a href="https://gentlemendistrict.com/how-to-build-confidence/">confidence comes in many ways</a>, and one of them is through appearance. When you look good, you’re more confident— this is a fact.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, why not take those two points that are just up for grabs?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, I feel bad for the average men that are not aware of the possibility of what they can do with their style. I do feel bad for them, and I hope they read this article.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you’re not sure of what colour you should be wearing, whether it’s for a shirt or whatever, going with the darker colour is usually your best bet. Go for the navy, black, darker shades of grey, for example. This is because darker colours are known to make you look skinnier, and black is always in!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can never go wrong with a black shirt—this goes for black denim too. If you’re trying to look tall and slim, you’re going to wear a great slim fit jean, and that’s going to give people that illusion of you being taller and thinner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The other benefit of darker colour as well is that they’re easier to match. So, if you’re learning about style now, you know darker tones are going to be your best friends. It’s going to be so much harder to match a baby blue or a redshirt into your look, than a navy black or a dark grey shirt.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You might be thinking, “what is a shirt-stay?” Well, it is precisely how it sounds. Don’t you hate when the shirt doesn’t tuck in properly, and there’s all this extra fabric hanging from the sides and the back?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Shirt stays are affordable. They are easy to use, and no one is going to be able to tell that you’re wearing one. They pull your shirt down and make your outfit look super crisp and fresh.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To be honest with you, I only learned about them a couple of years ago. I instantly knew that it was a life-changing hack, especially for you guys who work in an office or if you like tucking in your shirts for a classy look.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You know those people who only take photos with your sunglasses on, and you know why they do it?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, it is down to many reasons, scientific reasons. Studies have proved that the&nbsp;<strong>most attractive face is the most symmetrical face.</strong>&nbsp;So, the left side of your face needs to look more like the right side of your face. Most of the time, it does not.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everyone has a wrong side, but sunglasses will make your face look more symmetrical. Because they are the same on both sides, which means your face will be instantly more attractive. Glasses in particular, not only structure your face and make you look more stylish, but it makes you look smarter, and women love men that are intellect. This is why I recommend you guys.</p>

<h3 id="4-never-be-underdressed">4. Never Be Underdressed</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a big one! Don’t get caught underdressed. When in doubt, our recommendation to you is to overdress. You never want to be the least dressed guy in the room, ever. Being slightly overdressed is not a bad thing; it’s a lot better than being underdressed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even if you’re just going to get some errands done, don’t be that guy wearing like the dirty you ripped up clothes. Get comfortable basics that fit you properly, that’s it. You don’t need to try hard and try to look good at all times. All you have to do is not look like a slob.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 id="5-identify-a-low-end-shirt">5. Identify a Low-End Shirt</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Learn how to identify a low-end shirt. You know when you pick up a shirt, you look at the tag, and you’ve never heard of the brand before; now, you don’t know if it’s a good brand, or if it’s worth the money. Well, here’s a tip for you to make sure that you’re getting a quality item.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Check the buttons to see how well they’re made</strong>. A lot of times, you can tell by the threading on the buttons. You can see exactly how much effort was coerced into making these buttons or maybe not put into making these buttons. If the thread looks off like it looks like it was rushed, then you know that they didn’t go the extra mile—it’s probably a low-end shirt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Make sure to feel the fabric; sense the shirt, try it on before anything else because every shirt is not going to have the same fit. They’re all going to fit differently, and they’re all going to feel different.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://gentlemendistrict.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Choose-a-Clean-Design.jpg.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-8467"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you’re building out your closet, start with a clean and straightforward design. One of the biggest mistakes that I see guys making when they’re trying to look stylish is it going to go all out. When it comes to patterns and designs, it’s just all over the place because they are experimenting, right? They will go for t-shirts with the crazy prints, and the silver and leather bracelets, and gold bracelets, and jeans with like embroidered designs and patterns —This is not how to be stylish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I get what they may be trying to do, but that’s not it. That’s just being super loud and obnoxious. The best way to learn about fashion and style is to start with basics that are clean and solid. You start with those, and then you start adding a few things here and there to make your outfit pop and stand out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you’re just throwing a bunch of crazy things on, you’re going to look like a cheap Christmas tree. Clean designs are classy; they’re modern, even though they’re pure, they look high-end. It seems more expensive because patterns can look a little bit cheesy and corny sometimes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, our advice is for you to get clean white or black sneakers. Get modern sunglasses with a simple but effective design, and do not get denim with embroidered motifs and symbols on it.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m so glad that I learned this trick years ago because this is a life changer and I hate ironing my clothes. I’m not a fan of setting the iron board up, waiting for the iron to warm up and then sometimes I just needed to happen a lot faster than that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I remember the first time I saw my friend spraying his clothes with a spray bottle, and I was shocked and was like, “dude, what the hell are you doing?” Well, what I’ve discovered is, if your clothes are a little wrinkled and you’re on the go or in a rush, just hang them up and spray them with the water to get rid of the wrinkles. All you need is water.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s so easy, and the reality is if your shirt is entirely wrinkled and messed up, sorry man, you’re going to have to iron it. There’s no magic trick here. But if you just want a few wrinkles gone, this thing makes it easy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3 id="8-jean-crunch">8. Jean Crunch</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is an issue that every guy has with jeans. I’m talking about the infamous jeans crunch. I’ve seen this happen way too much, in which your pants just chomp up around your crotch area, and it looks like you got a little bit too excited.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If this is happening to you, then it means that your pants are too big for you around the waist area. A lot of men thinking that just wearing a belt or making it tight is going to fix the problem, but the truth is it’s not, it’s going to make it worse and it’s going to crunch up more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The proper way to fix this issue is to bring your pants to the nearest tailor. Have them get rid of any excess fabric and make sure they fit you the way they’re supposed to. Jeans are expensive, so, it’s worth reviving them by spending a little bit extra money at the tailor instead of wearing jeans that just don’t fit you right or buying new jeans.</p>

<h3 id="9-tuck-in-your-t-shirt">9. Tuck in your T-Shirt</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":8469} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://gentlemendistrict.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Tuck-in-your-T-Shirt.jpg.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-8469"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tucking in your t-shirt is such an easy trick that will change your outfits entirely as simple as it sounds, but it’s true. I’ll be honest, I’m a little bit ashamed of this, but not long ago, I thought that tucking in my shirts or t-shirts was kind of lame. But then, I stopped to think about it, and came to realise that I was the one who was being pretty lame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fashion is about being yourself. Try new things, show off different personalities. So, when I started tucking in my t-shirts and Flora shirts, I just discovered like a whole new world. I’m not saying you should always tuck in your shirt, but sometimes, you’re going to find that only by changing one thing, you’re going to change your look completely.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You’re going to look completely different, and that’s because most guys think that you can only tuck in your button-up shirt or your collared shirt for its special event, but that’s not true. You can wear a very casual outfit and tucking your t-shirt like the image above to add crisp detail to your fit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 id="10-shop-with-friends-or-partner">10. Shop with Friends or Partner</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whenever possible, do not shop alone bring someone with you. Shopping isn’t something that you want to rush, and it’s shown that we rush a lot more when we’re alone. Having an extra pair of eyes and some different opinions is super helpful. You don’t always have to do what they want but to learn to take criticism and hearing others out is a skill that we could all work on in today’s world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bringing a girl or your partner along might be an excellent idea too. Sometimes, it’s good to get a female perspective, especially if you’re looking for an outfit for a special event or a date.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A classic tip for you men who maybe have lame friends, who don’t want to go shopping with you—I know that happens to me sometimes—ask a random person at the store.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trust me; firstly, this is a great way to meet a new person; maybe you see a cute girl, and then you just go up to her and ask her for her opinion on a shirt that you’re trying on, why not? It’s a great icebreaker, and it’s an easy conversation starter. Secondly, you’re going to get some real feedback.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why should you speak to a stranger then? Well, this is a person who does not know you, and they don’t care you know about your feelings because they just met you. So, they’re not trying to please you. They will only give you their honest feedback— it’s a win-win.</p>

<h3 id="11-reduce-how-often-you-dry-clean">11. Reduce How Often You Dry Clean</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":8471} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://gentlemendistrict.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Reduce-How-Often-You-Dry-Clean-1-1024x683.jpeg.webp" alt="Reduce How Often You Dry Clean" class="wp-image-8471"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This may be a little weird or sound weird, but it’s true. Dry cleaning is not suitable for your clothes, so try to do it less often. I remember when dry cleaning all of my clothes all the time used to be like one of my dreams. I used to think that one day, I’m going to be able to afford dry cleaning all of my clothes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In reality, I learned that dry cleaning your clothes all the time damages your clothes. The dry-cleaning process is harsh. So, the high drying temperatures and the chemicals used in the dry-cleaning process can damage your garments or slowly decrease its lifespan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m not saying you shouldn’t dry clean, but only dry clean when you have to before an event. Or if it is a piece that just can’t be washed in the washer. If you only have a small stain somewhere, then try to hand wash that specific area to get rid of this stain instead of dry cleaning the whole thing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s not forget how expensive dry cleaning is. By dry-cleaning less often, you’re going to be saving some money in two ways—by protecting your clothes and from the dry-cleaning bill.</p>

<h3 id="12-simple-upgrade-wear-a-polo-shirt">12. Simple Upgrade—Wear a Polo Shirt</h3>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is such a super simple upgrade. Instead of wearing a simple t-shirt, try a polo shirt. Polo shirt instantly elevates one’s status. Wearing a polo shirt will make people probably think that you put a lot of effort into how you dress before leaving home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wearing a polo shirt will not take you any more effort than throwing on a regular t-shirt. But since a polo shirt is more structured, it makes it look like you put in more effort. It’s such a simple style hack or fashion trick that I encourage you to do going forward.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, next time you’re in your closet, instead of going for your basic t-shirt like you do every single time, try a polo shirt. Whether it’s a long sleeve or a short sleeve —which is my favourite as it shows my triceps— That structured collar will elevate your look.</p>

<h3 id="13-drop-the-logo">13. Drop the Logo</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unbranded pieces tend to have a higher more luxe feel to them because it leaves a sense of mystery. All of a sudden, people are no longer going to judge you on the price of the garment but more so on how it looks, how it feels, and how it fits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I don’t like wearing brands because it leaves a mystery. Instead of judging me on the brand, you judge me on the fit of the clothing, how it looks on me, how it fits, and how it feels.</p>

<h3 id="14-take-risks-by-trying-new-attires">14. Take Risks by Trying New Attires</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m sure you heard of this saying, “high risk, high reward.” Of course, you’re going to have some misses when you step outside your comfort zone trying something new. This is still the best way to cultivate your style, so you don’t look so robotic and like everybody else.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is why if you’re a guy, that maybe never worn a polo shirt or a button-down, and you feel like that’s outside your comfort zone, take a risk, try it once and see how it makes you think, and see how people compliment you or look at you or treat you differently. On the other hand, if your guy the only where’s Jordan, reduce doing that. Step out of that and try something different.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Try a clean white leather sneaker or try a loafer—something that’s outside your norm, that will develop your style.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you aren’t using your pair of sunglasses to shield your eyes and making you look sexy, please and please again, don’t put them on your head or your neck or behind your head—that just looks tacky.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Taking a look at the stylish men of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pittimmagine.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pitti Uomo</a>, the only elegant way to carry your frames when you’re not wearing them is on your chest pocket—this is subtlety at its best.

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whether that’s wearing sweats with your regular button-up, or a hoodie under a suit, or an overcoat, the lines of men are becoming more and more blurred, meaning that everything goes. We call this ‘hi-low dressing.’</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you learn to execute this correctly, the beauty of it is that now you can step outside your comfort zone and wear things that most of the time would seem stuffy. Still, in reality, you’re going to be comfortable in looking style.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
